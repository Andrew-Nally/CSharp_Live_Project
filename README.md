# CSharp_Live_Project
A project offered at The Tech Academy to students in the Full Stack Software Development Program

The C# Live Project was a little different than the Python project but held the same objective. In this project I woeked with a new team of developers developing a full scale MVC Web APplication in VIsual Studio utilizing Entity Framework code first. I used Agile methodologies and really got a chance to learn the DevOps program Azure. Once again we experienced the real -life work routines during a sprint, beginning with a sprint planning session, a daily standup, and a sprint retrospective at the end of each week.
Each student has the oppurtunity to task themselves with stories from either the frontend and/or the backend to help them develop their skills as a real life software developer.

For my contributiion to the project my first story was to fix the navigation link so that it displayed the correct page when the user clicked the link. That was simple enough...

My next challenge was a little more challenging and I was to fix the edit page of the image form and create the feature that displays a preview image of the photo being uploaded in addition to the current image already in its place. Then to save the new image as the replacement for the previous immage. After all is said and done, have the uploader validate that the image was a valid photo.

My third challenge was to design the edit layout page for the Cast Member screen following the image provided. This wasnt as challenging as I thought it wouldve been but was a lot of fun to revisit my CSS skills and techniques.
